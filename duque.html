        There is no stopping <l class="text-info">Metro Manila’s</l> imminent <strong>shift</strong> to the most lenient form of 
        <strong>community quarantine </strong>
        despite the recent detection of two COVID-19 mutations and rapid increase of coronavirus cases in 
        Central Visayas, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Friday.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Department of Health said a sharp, 
           <l class="text-danger">
           alarming rise in 
            <abbr title = "an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.">COVID-19</abbr>
           cases has been recorded in Central 
            Visayas, particularly in the Province of Cebu, Cebu City, Lapulapu, and Mandaue.
           </l>
        Out of the 50 samples 
        taken from COVID-19 patients in Region 7, 31 or 62% were found with both "mutations of concern to the 
        global community.” The mutations identified as <strong>E484K</strong> and <strong>N501Y</strong> were found in the 
        <strong>United Kingdom </strong>and 
        <strong>South Africa</strong> COVID-19 variants that are more transmissible.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for Duque, it remains unclear if the new mutations are to blame for the steep increase in cases 
        in the Visayan region. He, however, said that the region’s shift to modified general community quarantine 
        this year could be one of the reasons for the continuous rise in coronavirus infections in the area.

          “Marami tayong ibang factors na dapat alamin o obserbahan. Nag-MGCQ ang Region 7, so tumaas ang 
          mobility ng mga tao. Kung tumaas ang mobility, ang contact rate tumaas din, so transmission rate ay 
          tumaas din. Tingin ko iyan ang posibleng dahilan, pero pwedeng hindi lang siya ang dahilan. Maraming 
          dahilan,”

      <p class="text-muted">
        He said in a media briefing
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite this admission, he believes <l class="text-info">Metro Manila is ready to ease restrictions even if questions 
        remain unanswered if the mutations will develop into variants or if it increases virus transmissibility. 
        He said local officials need to scale up testing, tracing, and isolation efforts, adding minimum health 
        standards should be continuously enforced.

        Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. is also confident that the country is ready to shift to 
        <abbr title = "Moderate Enchance Community Quarantine">MGCQ</abbr> by next 
        month. The country’s COVID-19 task force has prepared for the eventual shift to MGCQ pending President 
        Rodrigo Duterte’s decision.

        Duque said they will continue to monitor Central Visayas if stricter lockdowns need to be enforced to 
        arrest the spread of COVID-19 and its mutations.
