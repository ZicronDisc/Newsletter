        Officials of the embattled  <abbr title="PhilHealth">Philippine Health Insurance Corporation</abbr> have stolen some ₱15 billion from 
        the agency using different fraudulent schemes, a former official claimed Tuesday. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The state-run agency's former anti-fraud legal officer <b>Thorrsson Montes Keith</b>, who earlier <b>resigned 
        due to "widespread corruption"</b> within the office, alleged that "mafia members" were in charge of what 
        he calls "crime of the year" due to anomalous transactions.
      </p>  
      <p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          "Naniniwala po ako na ang perang winaldas at ninakaw ay humigit kumulang ₱15 billion," 
          said Keith, 
          <footer class="blockquote-footer">testifying before the Senate Committee on the Whole.</footer>
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          "Naniniwala po ako na ang dahilan kung bakit hindi natatapos ang korapsyon sa PhilHealth at naging
           kultura na po nito, ay ang pagtatalaga ng mga sindikato o mafia ng kanilang kasamahan, kasabwat
            o kapwa sindikato sa mga matataas na posisyon na nakakatulong sa kanilang iligal operasyon."
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        <l class="text-info">Keith accused PhilHealth President and CEO Ricardo Morales</l> of also instructing him to talk to 
        Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission Commissioner Greco Belgica to amend a pending case 
        involving the agency's overpriced COVID-19 testing kits.
      </p>

          "Inutusan ako para hilutin ang kaso sa overpriced test kits,"
          <footer class="blockquote-footer"> Keith bared.</footer>
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The PhilHealth chief later tried to discredit Keith</b>,<l class="text-secondary"> saying the former official was "vengeful" 
        after being rejected for a position he coveted. Morales cited alleged sexual harassment cases
        against Keith and his removal from the police force as reasons for not hiring him as his
        executive assistant. </l>
      </p>
      <p>
        Morales added that he was doubtful about Keith's fraud allegations since in over nine months
         Keith had been the anti-fraud legal officer, he failed to submit any report on anomalies 
         in the agency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keith claimed that the <l class="text-danger">₱15 billion covers the unauthorized release of interim reimbursement
        mechanisms or funds </l> allocated for "fortuitous events" such as the pandemic, to hospitals
        who have not yet recorded COVID-19 cases. The amount also included the alleged overpriced 
        information technology systems the agency proposed to purchase, he added.
      </p>
      <p>
        PhilHealth board member <b>Alejandro Cabading</b> <l class="text-info">also pointed fingers at several officials for 
        allegedly manipulating operations inside PhilHealth to block corruption probes </l>. He named 
        Atty. Rodolfo del Rosario, now Senior Vice President of the Legal Sector; Corporate Secretary 
        Jonathan Mangaoang; Dennis Mas, SVP for Management Services Sector; and Renato Limsiaco, SVP 
        for the Fund Management Sector.

          "Ini-intimidate 'yung mga tao sa loob na mag-i-investigate,"
          <footer class="blockquote-footer">said Cabading.</footer>
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Senator Ping Lacson</b> <l class="text-info">also earlier gave the same names</l>, except for 
        Dr. Israel Pargas, SVP for Health Finance Policy Sector, and tagged
         them as the officials involved in the long-standing corruption 
         allegations within the agency.
      </p>
      <p>
        The senator alleged that these officials do not run out of <i>"malevolent
         schemes"</i> to enrich themselves of a deeply-rooted mafia syndicate" 
         manipulating the financial records of PhilHealth despite changes in 
         leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Del Rosario</b> <l class="text-info">denied his involvement</l> in any <i>"mafia"</i> within the agency,
         adding that he will take legal action against Cabading if he cannot 
         substantiate his accusation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Mas did not directly deny being part of a mafia but maintained
         that he was not charged by the Ombudsman as claimed by Lacson. Limsiaco
          denied manipulating PhilHealth's financial statements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>₱10 billion lost in fraud</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Morales said even a change of leadership wouldn't change the culture of 
        corruption within the agency. He said over ₱10 billion was potentially 
        lost to fraud last year. He later added that the agency is investigating 
        around 20,000 cases of potential fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
        He then pointed out that no healthcare system in the world is entirely 
        "fraud-free."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Corruption was there in the PhilHealth organization before I came in,
         and may stay if we don't put a proper system in place," the PhilHealth 
         chief said.
